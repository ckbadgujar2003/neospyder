# neospyder: Automated Vulnerability Detection & Alert System
## Overview
neospyder is a web-scraping tool designed to automate the detection of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) websites and other relevant online platforms. By aggregating Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) data in real-time, neospyder provides actionable alerts to help organizations quickly respond to emerging cybersecurity threats.

## Features
### Automated Web Scraping: Automatically scrape vulnerability data from OEM websites and public sources. The tool supports various formats including HTML, XML, and JSON.
### Real-Time OSINT Integration: Continuously monitors and extracts relevant data from open sources like vulnerability databases, RSS feeds, and Twitter API.
### Customizable Monitoring: Users can configure scraping frequency, sources, and alert mechanisms according to their needs.
### Alert System: Generates reports on identified vulnerabilities and sends alerts via email or Telegram.
### Detailed Vulnerability Classification: Provides detailed classification and mitigation strategies for detected vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Languages: Python
### Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Requests, Selenium
### OSINT Integration: Python Requests, RSS Feeds, Twitter API
### Database: MongoDB, SQLAlchemy
### Web Interface: React.js/Angular (Frontend), Flask/Django (Backend)
